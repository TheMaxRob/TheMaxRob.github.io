    "description": "A duo-dev passion project my friend and I started to improve school spirit at Emory. Many schools have small quirks unique to their schools, and we envisioned geoChat as Emory's; a collection of real-time, anonymous chatrooms only accessible when you are within each chatroom's specified zone on Emory's campus. This project taught me how to develop for production, create a CI/CD pipeline, and how to build efficient full-stack web applications.",

    "description": "I began developing this project after my semester abroad. I traveled a lot during this time period, often alone, and I realized that what makes or break these kinds of trips are the people you meet while traveling. To facilitate better travel experiences, I built a platform to help travelers meet each other in foreing cities. I learned how to design an efficient database, create smooth, safe user experience, and efficiently cache information to reduce database reads.",

This was my first personal project in which I worked on a large developer team with several classmates. Navigating a team of people all with different backgrounds and skill levels was difficult but taught me a lot about how to handle working with a diverse team.",
